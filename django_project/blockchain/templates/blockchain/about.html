	<h1>How does a blockchain technology work?</h1>

		<span style="font-weight: 400;">
			 A central aspect of blockchain technology is the distributed ledger,
			which contains a record of all previous transactions. It is called a
			distributed ledger because it is not stored in a central location, rather
			it is stored across a network of computers across the world. Key to the operation
			of a distributed ledger is ensuring the entire network collectively agrees with
			the contents of the ledger; this is the job of the consensus mechanism.

			 Behind many cryptoassets, there is a consensus mechanism. The purpose of a consensus mechanism
			is to verify that information being added to the ledger is valid i.e. the network is in consensus.
			This ensures that the next block being added represents the most current transactions on the network,
			preventing double spending and other invalid data from being appended to the blockchain. In addition,
			the consensus mechanism keeps the network from being derailed through constant forking.

	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">
			 There have been a number of different consensus mechanisms devised, each with their own pros and cons.
			They all serve the same core purpose as described above, but differ in methodology. The primary difference
			between varying consensus mechanisms is the way in which they delegate and reward the verification of transactions.
